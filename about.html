      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>
          I'm <strong>Mursal Esmati</strong>,a dedicated and ambitious Computer Science student from Afghanistan, driven by a deep passion for technology and innovation. My academic journey began with a vision ,a vision not only to master the world of computing but also to become a leading figure in tech and a strong advocate for women’s representation in this field.

Coming from a region where opportunities for women are often limited, I faced numerous obstacles along the way. However, I remained determined. I excelled in my undergraduate studies in Environmental Science, graduating as the top student in my program. Beyond academics, I actively engaged in national-level volunteer projects focused on environmental sustainability and community empowerment.

Today, I am channeling the same dedication into the field of Computer Science. From coding websites to exploring cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, I am committed to learning, growing, and contributing to meaningful change through technology.

My ultimate goal is to become not just a developer, but a leader who inspires others, especially young women to dream big and pursue their passions in tech. This portfolio represents a step in that journey, showcasing both where I’ve been and where I’m headed.
